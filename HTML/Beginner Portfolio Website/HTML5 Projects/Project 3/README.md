![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

A pure HTML project built to showcase various types of form inputs, validations, and semantic structure using only HTML5.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project contains multiple form examples designed to demonstrate key form elements in HTML5, including:

- Email input validation
- Range sliders
- Radio buttons and grouped choices
- Multiple selection dropdowns
- Semantic grouping with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`

Each form is wired to a testing endpoint (`https://httpbin.org/get`) to simulate data submission and response behavior in real-world form handling.
